## Projects in JavaScript with p5.js :

#### SPACE_GAME:
Simple 'game' made in p5.js. This space shooter requires player's ability to imagine it's actually in space as it has no meaningful graphics.

Installation:
* download and extract everything
* run index.html

Instructions:
* your ship follows your mouse
* mouse click to fire your weapons
* collect red and green boxes to increase weapons' level or replenish health points respectively
* have fun getting epilepsy attacks from projectiles' flickering when there're too many on the screen!

#### SNAKE:
Everyone knows the classic one, right? This time you:
* control the snek with arrow keys
* only lose the part of your tail you actually bite off, not all of it
* edges are portals
