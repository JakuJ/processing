Installation:
* download and extract everything

Instructions:
* your ship follows your mouse
* mouse click to fire your weapons
* collect red and green boxes to increase weapons' level or replenish health points respectively
* have fun getting epilepsy attacks from projectiles' flickering when there're too many on the screen!

SNAKE:
Everyone knows the classic one, right? This time you:
* control the snek with arrow keys
* only lose the part of your tail you actually bite off, not all of it
* edges are portals
